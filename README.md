Project Overview – COS60010 Semester 2, 2023
Client Details
Bright Boost is an after-school program that provides tutoring for high school students.
Students from local high schools can enrol in the program for a small fee, which is paid yearly
or per term, and can then attend Bright Boost sessions any number of weekdays after school.
Sessions run from 3:30pm to 5:30pm and are staffed by one or more tutors depending on the
day. Each tutor has expertise in one or more subject areas. Sessions are run on a drop-in, first-
come-first-served basis, where students can ask questions or simply use the space to work in.
Currently, tutors write their name and areas of expertise on a white board at the front of the
room, and students raise their hand if they have a question.
Project Description
The team at Bright Boost are generally happy with how their service runs, but they would like
to collect data on how it is being used. This will help them determine which subject areas they
should prioritise providing support for, and how many tutors they should try to have on duty
each day.
To this end, Bright Boost would like you to develop a prototype software application. At a
minimum, this application should provide a way of recording:
• How many students attend each session.
• How many questions are answered during each session about each subject area.
If possible, they would also be interested in knowing details about the content of the questions,
when they were asked, which tutor answered, and possibly even how much of the tutor’s time
was required to address it. They are also open to collecting any other data you feel would be
useful for their business.
They are not sure how this data should be entered – staff could record that they have answered
a question after doing so, or the system could double as a queue where students enter that
they would like help instead of just raising their hand.
Bright Boost would also like the system to be able to calculate and display statistics and
summaries of the data it collects, but they leave the decision of what summaries and statistics
would be useful to you. They would also be interested in using the system to display a timetable
of when tutors are scheduled, so students can plan their week accordingly.
Your team’s task is to build a working prototype application. Bright Boost are not requesting
that any specific technologies, approaches, or design ideas be used – all these decisions are
left to your team. As you are a software engineering team, you are also not expected to
produce high-quality visual assets. Furthermore, as this is a prototype you are not expected to
deploy your solution or provide a plan for doing so. Your team should focus on producing a
working prototype that demonstrates what a final product might be able to do.
